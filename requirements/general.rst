General Understanding
=====================

The ASGARD Inventory Analyzer is used to create and inventory of
your endpoints. Data can be fed into it by connecting existing 
ASGARD instances or by deploying NMAP Agents. By specifying
Assignment Rules you can decide if a new asset will be created
or an existing one updated.

Performance Considerations
--------------------------

Since your Inventory Analyzer is running on a separate instance,
it will not create a big performance impact on your existing 
environment.
