Data Sources
============

In this chapter we will explain what Data Sources are and how
to use them. We need to define data sources before we can create
``Discovery`` tasks to collect information from those data sources.

This step should be the first thing you set up in a new environment.

Currently we have three data sources available for asset import:

* ASGARDs
* NMAP Agents
* CSV Templates
